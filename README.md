## 1.1 Introduction

Hello and welcome to *Title Pending*!  
This application is designed to be a multi-functional platform with the goal of becoming a free-to-use software/web application for Magic: The Gathering players of all experience levels.

The purpose of this app is to help players build, analyze, and optimize decks by offering card suggestions, synergy insights, and evaluations of deck strengths and weaknesses (e.g., ramp, draw, removal).

Whether you're a new player looking to improve your first deck or a seasoned brewer searching for efficiency and creativity, this tool is built for you.

This README will cover:
- The basic structure of the project
- The design and related software used to develop the application
- The product roadmap — including what is currently implemented and what is planned for future development

### 1.11 Background

I grew up collecting Pokémon cards (different franchise, but stay with me), and it was something I loved doing with my friends. The only downside was that, even though you could build decks with the cards, many of the ones pulled from packs were meant more for collecting than actual gameplay.

When I got to college, my friends convinced me to try Magic: The Gathering. I really appreciated the art style of the cards—and having an excuse to do something non-video-game-related. For my 19th birthday, they bought me my first precon (preconstructed deck), and from that point on, I was hooked. I’ve been addicted to building, playtesting, and playing Commander decks with my friends ever since.

### 1.12 Why Build This Project?

So why did I build this project?

One of the most important things I look for when building a new deck is figuring out what pieces work well together and how well-equipped the deck is to handle various threats. While there are plenty of great resources out there—like Moxfield, MTGGoldfish, EDHREC, and others—I often find myself jumping between all of them to find the best synergistic cards for my deck’s themes.

The goal of this project is to create a **comprehensive tool and guide** so players don’t have to bounce between ten different websites just to figure out what goes best in their deck.
